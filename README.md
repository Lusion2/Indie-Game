# Indie-Game
This is a repository for my Indie Game code, just for safekeeping

# How to Build
This uses G++ Makefile. If installed, just type "make" into the terminal and it will build the project into a build directory.
After, type ./build/main and it will (hopefully) run the application.

# Dependencies
- SFML

# Additional Info
This project is in its extremely early stages, development will likely be slow and I'll probably soon add a development roadmap to the repository... maybe.

P.S. I know the code is probably not super well written but this is one of my first large projects so I'm still learning.
